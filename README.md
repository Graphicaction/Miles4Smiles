## User Story

```
As an avid runner passionate about my local community
I want to track my races and compete against other runners
So that I can raise money for local businesses plus awareness for a healthy lifestyle
```

## Description

React Application that allows runners to connect, compete and create challenges that lead to donations to local businesses in their area.
In a period of economic lockdown and social isolation it can be difficult to find motivation to get out and be active. Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, this application looks to promote a healthy lifestyle while also advocating for local businesses. Users can register to compete against other athletes where the slower runner donates a pledged amount to a selected business. Also the runners can track and log their recent races (5k, 10k, Half Marathon or Full Marathon).
